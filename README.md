The polarimetry-related data analysis package for solar system small bodies.

In the field of solar system polarimetry, we normally are interested in the polarimetric curve as a function of phase angle. This phase angle dependency is visible only in the solar system, since it is almost a constant for objects at farther than parsec scale.

Here I intend to include empirical models (Lumme-Muinonen, Shestopalov, log-sin, log-quadratic, log-exponential) which fits the polarimetric phase curve ($ P_r(\alpha) $) and the fitting modules from `astropy`.
